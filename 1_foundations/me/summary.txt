My name is Ameed Ghanem. I'm a software developer. I live in Zimmer, ISrael.
I love all foods, particularly Steaks, but strangely I'm repelled by all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest. MY favorate fruit is date!
